##  Effect of Anti-Osteoporotic Treatments on Circulating and Bone Micro RNA Patterns in Osteopenic ZDF RATS

The paper examines the affects that miRNA has on bone development and it's role in T2DM through collecting and analyzing serum and bone tissue samples from a rat model of T2DM, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty Model (ZDF) for short who received four different treatment options such as anti-sclerostin, parathyroid hormone or PTH, insulin, or a placebo.

These samples were then run through an untargeted microRNA NGS discovery assay, miND, to quantify miRNA levels in both serum and bone tissue samples, also known as ulna samples. Using their sequencing data, they performed a hierarchical clustering analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, gene target network analysis and cell-type enrichment analysis to select for significant miRNA biomarkers of diabetic bone disease.

To examine which miRNAs were dysregulated, the authors created volcano graphs that compared ZDF placebo vs WT-placebo. They also created two other volcano graphs to view which miRNAs were regulated through treatment with either insulin or anti-scl by comparing ZDF-placebo vs ZDF-insulin, and ZDF-placebo vs ZDF-anti-scl.

Our goal is to replicate their work to examine if it is reproducable. We decided to focus on recreating the volcano plots due to their importance in demonstrating the overall results of the paper.

# Data Storage
Due to the large amount of data generated (60 GB +), github did not work as a storage solution. So, all data generated from our methods was uploaded to CyBox (https://iastate.account.box.com/login).

# Organization

All data generated that was not uploaded to github will be located in the data folder, and any code generated for data inspection, processing, and visualization will be located in the code folder. If you would like to find more information about specific chunks of the code works, it will likely be located in the script with a name similar to the process you are interested in, in the code comments.
