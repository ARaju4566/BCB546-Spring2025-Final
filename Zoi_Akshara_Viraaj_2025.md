Type 2 Diabetes is diagnosed when a person’s body begins to not respond to insulin or when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels within a healthy range, 
and then as a result glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of being absorbed by a person's cells.


T2DM accounts for 90% of all diabetes cases in adults and due to the obesity epidemic it has become increasingly prevalent.
Not only does it affect how the body absorbs glucose but it also affects bone health by lowering bone material density in the later stages of the disease, which increases mortality and healthcare costs.
Studies have also suggested that type 1 and type 2 diabetes have different mechanisms that lead to bone fragility that haven’t been researched yet, and they have also shown that miRNAs play a crucial role in both diabetes and bone development.

The paper examines the affects that miRNA has on bone development and it's role in T2DM through collecting and analyzing serum and bone tissue samples from a rat model of T2DM, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty Model (ZDF) for short who received four different treatment options such as anti-sclerostin, parathyroid hormone or PTH, insulin, or a placebo.

These samples were then run through an untargeted microRNA NGS discovery assay, miND, to quantify miRNA levels in both serum and bone tissue samples, also known as ulna samples.
Using their sequencing data, they performed a hierarchical clustering analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, gene target network analysis and cell-type enrichment analysis to select for significant miRNA biomarkers of diabetic bone disease.

To examine which miRNAs were dysregulated, the authors created volcano graphs that compared ZDF placebo vs WT-placebo. They also created two other volcano graphs to view which miRNAs were regulated through treatment with either insulin or anti-scl by comparing ZDF-placebo vs ZDF-insulin, and ZDF-placebo vs ZDF-anti-scl.


We decided to replicate the volcano graphs because they depict the main findings of the paper and are easy to understand.
