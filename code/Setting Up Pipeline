## Initiate Conda
Conda is another tool that helps install all relevant tools and stores it in an environment. First install Conda and initialize. Then create an environment/pipeline where you install specific tools for a project and activate it.
conda 24.11.3
conda create -n miR_ref_pipeline -y
conda activate miR_ref_pipeline

## Downloading and Extracting Packages
Our pipeline was named miR_ref since weâ€™re trying to replicate the reference pipeline from the Journal Article. 
Conda downloads software from different channels called channels. They are bioinformatics specialized (bioconda) and conda (default) and community channels (conda-forge)

conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge fastqc cutadapt mirdeep2 multiqc bowtie -y
conda install -c bioconda samtools
conda install -c bioconda seqtk
